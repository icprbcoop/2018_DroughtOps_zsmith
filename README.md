# 2018_DroughtOps_zsmith
This is the Shiny app created by Zachary Smith to support CO-OP drought operations. It displays graphs of Potomac River flows, flow forecasts, and demands. It reads csv files containing flow and demand time series data - that are created by his companion Shiny app, flow_pull.
